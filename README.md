# Cliptale ðŸ“Ž

> - Combination of _clipping_ (method to clip off something) + _tales_ (stories - Instagram)

Automate your Instagram stories clipping using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).

**What is _clipping_ in Marketing?**

Since Instagram stories have a period of 24 hours, _clipping_ allows you to record this content to later be shared with the customer. It can also be considered as a consumer analysis tool, often referred to as _target_.

## The problem we try to solve

As a Campaign Manager, with several campaigns in hand with different IG profiles, it takes a lot of time to run each account and perform the clipping.

## The solution

_cliptale_ automates the clipping of Instagram stories, making this process faster, easier and more efficient. Just provide a list of IG profiles, and _cliptale_ will return the current available stories content in `.jpeg` format, and saved them into a dedicated folder.

## VS Code

`cliptale` has a `.vscode` folder setup with some default settings and recommended extensions for VS Code editor.

To start using these settings, open your terminal and run:

```bash
# In root
cp .vscode/settings.json.default .vscode/settings.json
